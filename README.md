About this project: 

In this analysis, we would like to predict the price of used cars of 9 brands. We first combined the dataset from 9 brands, factorizing and grouping cetegorical variables and dealing with NA values. Then, we used the function called stepAIC which offers stepwise regression for selecting independent variables. We improved the model by log-transformation and removing outliers. Eventually, we reach a final version of the model that yields the R^2 of 0.854.
